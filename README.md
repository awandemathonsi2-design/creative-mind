'''
Good understanding of functions and variables.
indoor.py - I understand lower()
playback.py - I understand replace()
faces.py - return: 1)Exit a function 2)Return a value to the caller 3)Return None by default
           Define a function then call it at the very end to avoid a NameError
einstein.py - pow(base, exponent)
tip.py - f"....{}..." is more readable. I understand float
'''

'''
Good understanding of conditionals.
deep.py - I understand how to apply conditionals
bank.py - startswith(value, start, end) method returns True if the string starts with the specified value, otherwise False.
extensions.py - Match statement is neater and more readable than if statements
interpreter.py - 
meal.py - if __name__ == "__main__": 
'''

'''
Average understanding of loops: I didn't feel confident
camel.py - isupper() checks whether a string is uppercase. *Unfortunately the output and command prompt are on the same line.
coke.py - When using the while True loop, use the break statement or return to exit the loop.
twttr.py - 
plates.py - isalpha() checks that it's an alphabet
            isdigit() checks that it's a digit
            isalnum() checks that it's alphanumeric
            isnumeric() checks if all the characters in the text are numeric (E.g 0 to 9, 2/3 but not -1 or 1.5)
nutrition.py -
