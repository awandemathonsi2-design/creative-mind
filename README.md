'''
Good understanding of functions and variables.
indoor.py - I understand lower()
playback.py - I understand replace()
faces.py - return: 1)Exit a function 2)Return a value to the caller 3)Return None by default
           Define a function then call it at the very end to avoid a NameError
einstein.py - pow(base, exponent)
tip.py - f"....{}..." is more readable. I understand float
'''

'''
Good understanding of conditionals.
deep.py - I understand how to apply conditionals
bank.py - startswith(value, start, end) method returns True if the string starts with the specified value, otherwise False.
extensions.py - Match statement is neater and more readable than if statements
interpreter.py - 
meal.py - if __name__ == "__main__": 
'''

'''
Average understanding of loops: I didn't feel confident
camel.py - isupper() checks whether a string is uppercase. *Unfortunately the output and command prompt are on the same line.
coke.py - When using the while True loop, use the break statement or return to exit the loop.
twttr.py - 
plates.py - isalpha() checks that it's an alphabet
            isdigit() checks that it's a digit
            isalnum() checks that it's alphanumeric
            isnumeric() checks if all the characters in the text are numeric (E.g 0 to 9, 2/3 but not -1 or 1.5)
nutrition.py - 
'''

'''
Good understanding of exceptions.
fuel.py - ValueError exception occurs if a function receives a value of wrong type.
          ZeroDivisionError is raised when a program attempts to perform a division operation where the denominator is zero.
taqueria.py - KeyError exception occurs when you use a key on a dictionary, and the key does not exist.
              EOFError is raised when the input() function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data.
grocery.py - 
outdated.py - {:.2f} displayed as a number with two decimals. {:02}

test_plates.py - 
test_fuel.py - pytest can check whether a function has raised an exception.
